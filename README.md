# MarketTracker

A minimal Flask dashboard to display selected market indices using yfinance.

## Setup

Install dependencies (requires internet access to reach PyPI):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

The app relies on **matplotlib** for rendering charts, which is installed via
`requirements.txt`.

Open your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.
