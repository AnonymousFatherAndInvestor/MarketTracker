# MarketTracker

A minimal Flask dashboard to display selected market indices using yfinance.

## Setup

Install dependencies (requires internet access to download packages). The app
uses pandas plotting, which relies on `matplotlib`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.
